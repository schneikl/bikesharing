# Des Moines Bikesharing Analysis 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze NYC bikesharing data in order to convince our investor that a similar program in Des Moines makes sense. To do this, we analyzed a number of data points that can be found in the attached Tableau story.

## Results of Analysis
You'll find the results of my analysis within the linked Tableau story below, with captions summarizing each graphic's data.

## Summary of Analysis
This analysis supports that bikesharing is very popular as a means of transportation on weekdays for commutes, as well as on weekends for errands or recreational purposes. Keys to success would be to start with offers that target subscribing, as those customers use the service more frequently. Additionally, while we found from the NYC data that male use is significantly higher than female use, I believe putting an emphasis on female advertising could lead to more customers, as men may be more naturally drawn to bikesharing as the data from NYC supports.

A couple pieces of data that could further support the findings would be the male vs female breakdown of NYC vs Des Moines, along with an analysis of public transportation options within NYC vs Des Moines.
